# Specify the port name for your In-System Programmer (ISP) device or cable here.
#  For a FTDI USB-to-UART converter on Windows this is something like COM2 (check in the Windows Device Manager under Ports for the number) 
#    In XP: Right-click My Computer, click "Properties" then navigate to the "Hardware" tab followed by clicking "Device Manager".
#    Scroll down to "Ports" and click the "+" to the left of the name. Finally read the "COM" number next to the name "USB Serial Port (COMx)".
#  For a FTDI USB-to-UART converter on Linux this is something like /dev/ttyUSB0 (for a listing of USB serial ports, run: ls /dev/ttyUSB* ).
#  For a cheap SparkFun AVR-PG1B serial programmer on Windows this is typically COM1.
#    You can check using steps similar to above, but looking at the entry named "Communications Port (COMx)".
#  For a cheap SparkFun AVR-PG1B serial programmer on Linux this is something like /dev/ttyS0
#  For a fancy Atmel AVRISP mkII In-System Programmer simply enter usb (lowercase is important).
#    On Windows, you may need to install the LibUSB drivers included with WinAVR at: <WinAVR folder>\utils\libusb\bin\avrisp2.inf
#  For a cheapo PonyProg or Futurlec style parallel port programmer enter lpt1 (lowercase is important).

#  We have configured this target so that it only compiles the program into .elf and .hex files, and displays their final sizes.

#for a map, add: -Wl,-Map,$(PROJECTNAME).map
#for a lst, add: -Wa,-adhlms=$(PROJECTNAME).lst
#tried unsuccessfully to remove unused code with: -Wl,-static -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections
#the -g is required to get C code interspersed in the disassembly listing

# This target can be called to delete any existing compiled files (binaries), so you know that your next compile is fresh.
# The dash in front of rm is not passed to the shell, and just tells make to keep running if an error code is returned by rm.
clean:

# This target generates a .lss extended listing file from your compiled .elf file, and prints info on the sections.
# The file shows you the assembly code with your original C code interspersed between it to help you make sense of the assembly.
# This allows you to inspect the actual AVR instructions that your code will be running, which is useful to compare 
# two similar implementations and pick the more optimized version, or to verify correctness of an operation.
